# Marathon-Analysis
A personal project to understand how the marathon has changed over time (2000-2020).

The data has been scraped from marathonguide.com, which is a website that stores mostly US Marathons, with some major international ones such as The London Marathon. There are 12,000 marathons, with the lowest logged year being 2020 with 209 marathons, and the highest being 2016 with 896 marathons.

The project is split into the original webscraping notebook, a formatting notebook, and a notebook with the analysis on it.
